			This research paper takes the maximum flow problem and changes the environment to simulate different situations beyond the traditional problem where the authority controls every node. The paper starts by introducing some important terms that the reader must be familiar with in order to understand the rest of the essay. It explains exactly what a flow network is as well as what the traditional maximum flow problem aims to solve. There are many situations where the maximum flow problem can be applied that cover many different disciplines. Vehicle traffic on roads, fluids flowing through pipes, information packets being transmitted over a network, and elimination in tournaments are all examples of situations where the maximum flow problem is useful for finding optimal solutions. Once the author has given a sufficient amount of background information on the problem, they move onto introducing their specific research focus. That focus is expanding the traditional problem into a more diverse set of situations beyond one where every node is controlled by the same authority. The main example for this is in the area of software defined networks. In this area, there are some nodes that are controlled by a central controller while other nodes behave by following different protocols. With this new type of problem, the author suggests accounting for the game-theoretic nature of this kind of situation. The first game discussed is two-player flow games with a MIN and a MAX player. The MAX player represents the authority attempting to direct maximum flow to the target. The MIN player represents the environment that is out of control of the authority. The paper defines formal formulas and definitions for mathematical representations of the new maximum flow problem. This specific situation is a Stackelberg game with MAX as the leader since MAX is attempting to maximize its quantity of flow regardless of the strategy used by MIN. An important difference between the new problem and the traditional problem is that flow conservation is not necessarily respected. This means that MIN can direct flow to vertices who can not handle the flow due to their outgoing capacity being too small. The first example given is a very simple flow network that demonstrates how nodes that are not controlled by the main authority can affect the maximum flow. The ideal maximum flow would be two but the maximum flow that can be ensured is only one since the MIN player is able to direct one of the flows away from the target destination. The next section talks about how the transition from one player to two players relates to different fields. The new problem definition is similar to algorithmic game theory which applies to the more open nature of modern computing environments. It also calculates the changes to the related complexities and computational prices. The essay moves onto some new situations and goals that can be solved by the maximum flow problem. One of these goals is to find a strategy that ensures there is no loss of flow possible. This means that regardless of the MIN player’s strategy, all of the flow leaving the source will reach the target. The other goal is to calculate maximum flow using non-integral flow values. This means that the flow can be 1.2 instead of just 1 and this changes the problem significantly. While the traditional maximum flow problem can be solved for an optimal solution using integral flows, the new problem with two players can have higher flows by using non-integral flows. This introduces several complexities and the problem of finding the highest ensured flow is still open. The next situation introduced is for the case where the authority has no control over any nodes in the network. They give the specific example of a city trying to evacuate through a road network. At every node, the flow goes to an arbitrary outgoing edge. In the evacuation situation, this means every driver chooses an arbitrary route to take that is not filled up yet. When a node has more incoming flow than outgoing flow, the excess flow is lost or a traffic jam occurs. A similar example is with a communication network that is sending information packets. A router on the path might receive more packets then it can send out which results in the packets being dropped and lost. For these situations, the goal is to find the quantity of flow that will always reach the target even in the worst case scenario. This is like a flow network where every node is owned by MIN which would be the worst case scenario since MAX is not able to send the flow where it wants and MIN can send the flow away from the target. This problem is named the unfortunate-flow problem which is tasked with calculating the unfortunate flow value that is guaranteed to reach the target. The given example demonstrates how the optimal maximum flow for a graph where MAX has all of the nodes under control is eight. When MIN is in control, the strategy is to waste as much flow as possible and it is able to waste four flow. This means that the unfortunate flow value is five since at least five flow will always reach the target. The essay starts explaining how the unfortunate-flow problem can be calculated and gives the complexities associated with the calculation. The problem can be solved in strongly polynomial time given that there are a logarithmic number of funnels. A funnel in this context is any node that can take in more flow then it can output. This property means that a funnel can cause flow to be lost and thus act as a bottle neck in the flow network. There are a few more specific variants of the problem that are mentioned but not discussed which are integral unfortunate flow, controlled unfortunate flow, and no-loss controlled unfortunate flow.
