			<h2>Kids-U Database Website - UTD EPICS</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/UTDallasEPICS/Kids-U-Database-Reporting" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>I worked as Project Manager along with 4 students to create an 
ASP.NET website for the non-profit organization Kids-U. It was a 
challenging and interesting
				project that taught me about the MVC architecture and SQL databases 
along with offering lots of programming practice. Kids-U helps tutor 
low-income
				children and needed a way to organize all of their student data and 
grades. This project was offered by UT Dallas through the EPICS elective
 class 
				where students volunteer their time to develop engineering and 
software solutions for non-profts.
			</p>
			<p>This was the third semester of the projects' development with 
EPICS so when I came to the project the basic framework of the website 
was already made.
				There was still plenty of work to be done and I started by 
implementing the searching and sorting features. From there I created 
the Report Card and 
				Outcome Measurement pages which are similar to the Student 
Enrollment page. A substantial portion of my time was spent on 
refactoring code from prior teams
				and making small tweaks that improve usability and security. Things 
like back buttons that preserve search settings and preventing IDOR 
vulnerabilities
				probably won't be noticed much but if they didn't exist it would 
cause problems.
			</p>
			<p>This was also a great project to work on team collaboration and 
interacting with clients. Our team met several times with the project 
partner to showcase
				progress and ask for feedback. I got to elicit requirements and 
practice understanding what a customer needs in a product. On our team, I
 was the most
				comfortable with the programming work and was responsible for most 
of the progress during the semester. Because of this, I was able to help
 out my teammates
				who were struggling by debugging issues and brainstorming solutions.

			<h2>When Am I? - ACM Projects</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/acm-projects/When-Am-I/" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>When Am I? is a mobile app that uses historical data pulled from 
the Internet to teach the user a brief history about the place they are 
standing. I helped 
				create this app through ACM Projects, a semester long program where 
students build a project under the guidance of a project mentor. This 
was my first time
				working with a mobile app and I learned a lot about working on a 
team and collaborative development.
			</p>
			<p>We used React Native with Firebase to create the app and I worked 
full stack but mainly focused on the backend. There are over 12,000 
markers to view
				throughout all of Texas. I did a lot of work with the database to 
organize the data and clean out markers that had missing or incorrect 
data, removing about 
				5,000 markers. Loading lots of markers was pretty slow so I worked 
on optimising the query and restricting searches to only around the 
user. I created user 
				profiles and got statistics from the database about the most popular
 tags which were then used for the user to track how many sites they 
visited. On the 
				frontend, I got to work with the team to connect and display the 
back end query results on the map as well as the search page and user 
profiles.

			<h2>Tree Generator</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Tree_Generator" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>A Java program that generates random 2D trees based on several 
parameters. I made this project to see if I could create random trees 
that look somewhat 
				realistic and to learn basic Java graphics. The default values allow
 for some pretty good looking trees although there are still some that 
don't exactly
				resemble real life. </p>
			<p>Getting the branches to connect well was the hardest part. I 
settled with allowing branches to be between 40 and 90 percent of the 
previous branch's
				length to stop branches from looking very lopsided. The angle of the
 branch is random within a range set by the user. The angle is 
calculated from the
				previous branch's angle so that they line up well.</p>

			<h2>Erosion Simulator</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Erosion_Simulator" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>A Java program that simulates erosion on a random height map in 
order to generate terrain. The user presses the 'Erode' button until the
 random points resemble
				mountains and valleys.</p>
			<p>The most interesting part of this project is designing the erosion
 function to determine how the random points smooth together. The 
current method starts by choosing a random point for 
				a water drop to remove a set amount of dirt. Then the droplet 
carries the dirt to a neighboring lower point, leaving dirt behind as it
 moves. The drop stops after it runs out of dirt or is
				at the bottom of a valley.

			<h2>Password Manager</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Password_Manager" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>This project is a simple application to interact with a text file 
of login information. To protect the file from being read by anyone, 
users 
				choose a password that is used to encrypt the file with. This way 
the file can't be read unless you know the correct password.</p>
			<p>I decided to write this project so that I could refresh my basic 
C++ skills after a semester of not using them. I was also able to 
incorporate data 
				structures through a binary tree storage system.</p>

		<div id="website" class="project">
			<h2>Personal Website</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Personal_Website" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>This website serves as an easy place to showcase for all my 
programming projects. The site itself is a project as I have used it to 
				learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

			<h2>MIPS Connect 4</h2>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ixAhl9xCA4&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank">Video showcasing game</a>
			<p>This was a semester long project for my computer architecture 
class that was worked on by myself and two others. I wrote the majority 
of the MIPS
				assembly code to get the game working. The project taught me a lot 
about solving problems in an efficient manner as choosing a bad solution
 would 
				lead to an excess amount of code.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenge was choosing how to represent the position 
of pieces in memory. The solution I came up with was to store the game 
board as
				one long string. This decision ended up making it very simple to 
traverse the board for other functions of the game.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I got my master's and bachelor's in computer science at the University of Texas at 
Dallas. Now I am a software developer for Texas Instruments supporting a wide variety of apps and tech stacks. 
I enjoy learning about new technologies and discovering interesting solutions to problems. 
			A passion for tinkering and creating my own projects makes up a large
 portion for why I chose computer science. 
			Outside of programming, I try to spend my spare time being active by 
playing volleyball and going for bike rides.</p>
