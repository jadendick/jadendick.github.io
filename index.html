		<p>This research paper takes the maximum flow problem and changes the environment to simulate different situations beyond the traditional problem where the authority controls every node. The paper starts by introducing some important terms that the reader must be familiar with in order to understand the rest of the essay. It explains exactly what a flow network is as well as what the traditional maximum flow problem aims to solve. There are many situations where the maximum flow problem can be applied that cover many different disciplines. Vehicle traffic on roads, fluids flowing through pipes, information packets being transmitted over a network, and elimination in tournaments are all examples of situations where the maximum flow problem is useful for finding optimal solutions. Once the author has given a sufficient amount of background information on the problem, they move onto introducing their specific research focus. That focus is expanding the traditional problem into a more diverse set of situations beyond one where every node is controlled by the same authority. The main example for this is in the area of software defined networks. In this area, there are some nodes that are controlled by a central controller while other nodes behave by following different protocols. With this new type of problem, the author suggests accounting for the game-theoretic nature of this kind of situation. The first game discussed is two-player flow games with a MIN and a MAX player. The MAX player represents the authority attempting to direct maximum flow to the target. The MIN player represents the environment that is out of control of the authority. The paper defines formal formulas and definitions for mathematical representations of the new maximum flow problem. This specific situation is a Stackelberg game with MAX as the leader since MAX is attempting to maximize its quantity of flow regardless of the strategy used by MIN. An important difference between the new problem and the traditional problem is that flow conservation is not necessarily respected. This means that MIN can direct flow to vertices who can not handle the flow due to their outgoing capacity being too small. The first example given is a very simple flow network that demonstrates how nodes that are not controlled by the main authority can affect the maximum flow. The ideal maximum flow would be two but the maximum flow that can be ensured is only one since the MIN player is able to direct one of the flows away from the target destination. The next section talks about how the transition from one player to two players relates to different fields. The new problem definition is similar to algorithmic game theory which applies to the more open nature of modern computing environments. It also calculates the changes to the related complexities and computational prices. The essay moves onto some new situations and goals that can be solved by the maximum flow problem. One of these goals is to find a strategy that ensures there is no loss of flow possible. This means that regardless of the MIN playerâ€™s strategy, all of the flow leaving the source will reach the target. The other goal is to calculate maximum flow using non-integral flow values. This means that the flow can be 1.2 instead of just 1 and this changes the problem significantly. While the traditional maximum flow problem can be solved for an optimal solution using integral flows, the new problem with two players can have higher flows by using non-integral flows. This introduces several complexities and the problem of finding the highest ensured flow is still open. The next situation introduced is for the case where the authority has no control over any nodes in the network. They give the </p>
